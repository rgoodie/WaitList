User Waitlist
=============
What
-
A Wait List that will insert a user into predefined roles upon account creation. Good to use in situations where modules handling SSO or LDAP will initially create an account. Upon account creation, roles will be automatically added to the user. 

Why
-
I have a situation where a client uses a centralized management system for logins (OpenAM).  They heavily use roles in their applications and need users immediately added to Roles on their first login. 

How
-
An individual with permission, adds user names to a wait list. Drupal then watches for when these names first login (typically after LDAP or OpenAM creates the account). Once the user is added to those Roles, the wait list entry is removed. 

Where
-
To see what's going on, look at the database table `waitlist` and tail watchdog `drush wd-show --tail`.




How to use
=
First go to the administration page as such.

![Adding Names](img/adding_names.png "Adding names")

Go about creating the user. In some cases your OpenAM or LDAP module may do this for you based off your central 
identity management infrastructure. 

For my own testing on localhost, I manually created a user through drush via

```
$ drush ucrt aaa --password=aaa
```

Then log in as that new user:

!['New user log in'](img/login_as_that_new_user.png "Logging in as new user")


Return to the browser in which you've logged in as an administrator:
!['People listing'](img/notice_user_roles.png "Notice User Roles")


To following along the process, tail the WatchDog log:

```
